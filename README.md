# rock-paper-scissors-quest (RPSQ)
The stupidest game idea ever

## Install Dependencies
Please run `go get` in the root directory to install dependencies.

## Start the game!
Now you're ready for the most epic version of Rock Paper Scissors you can imagine! Run `go run .` in your terminal to start your adventure. 

## WTF is this?
RPSQ is a text based game, so use your imagination. Play Rock Paper Scissors against monsters as you decend into the mysteries of the dungeon. If you lose a round, it's all over and you'll have to start again. 

## Difficulty
There are 3 difficulty settings, each determining the likelyhood of a RPS move being thrown by a monster. 

### Easy
Each Monster has a favourite move, they will only ever throw that move. Study the monster closely to determine how best to defeat them in combat.

### Medium 
Once you have mastered the Easy difficulty, give Medium difficulty a try. Monsters still have a preference, but have a 33.333% chance of switching it up. 

### Hard
There is no predicting what move a monster will throw. The dungeon has become self aware and has bestowed the knowledge on it's inhabitants that there is no strategy; just pure random chaos. Good luck. 

Enjoy Rock Paper Scissors Quest
